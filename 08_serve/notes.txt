v0:
- seems pretty normal
- all it does is return no hablo queso
- shows the return value even if you don't print the name
v1:
- we predicted how print(__name__) didn't affect the return statement from showing
- it still gives you the link to the website after commenting out the run
v2:
- print statements go directly to the thonny shell AFTER you click the link
v3:
- app.debug = true causes the link to not connect
v4:
-
