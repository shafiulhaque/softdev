        <h2>FEATURE: Grid Cells</h2>
        In Foundation, grids are a great way to split up your work!
        <br>In order to create a comprehensive grid, you must have a divider for the <b>grid-x grid-padding-x</b>, the <b>type of grid cell</b>, and a <b>primary callout</b>.
      </div>
      <br>

      <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">

          <div class="primary callout">
            <p>This is a twelve cell section in a grid-x.
            In this case, the class for the divider would be a large-12 cell.</p>

        </div>
