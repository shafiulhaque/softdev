DISCO
- forms can be created in Foundation through using the <form> tag
- different test-like features you can use to have others answer questions
- by using the <link> and <script> tags at the beginning, we can link the CSS and JS from our original download.

Q/C/C
- the cell and grid creation can be very confusing and convoluted because there are many ways to do it
- how does the <link> and <script> extract information from those sources specifically?
