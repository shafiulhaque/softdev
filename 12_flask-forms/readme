Disco:
- we need to ues "POST" method in the html template
- request.forms.get() is an alternative tro request.args when using a POST method
- the username and password don't appear in the url

QCC:
- why would people use a get request if a post request is more secure?
- what is the real difference between the implementations of get and post?
